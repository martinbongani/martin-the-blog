          <h5>History Of Computers</h5>
          <p class="par">
            Computers have come a long way since the first mainframe computers
            were created in the 1940s. These early computers were large and
            expensive machines that were primarily used by government agencies
            and large corporations. However, as technology advanced, computers
            became smaller, more affordable, and more accessible to the general
            public.

          <h5>The Top 10 Fastest Cars In The World</h5>
          <h6>10. Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut</h6>
          <img
            src="images/koenigsegg-jesko-absolut.jpeg"
            alt="Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut"
          />
          <p class="par">
            The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut can hit a top speed of 330 mph / 531
            kph (in theory) with a 0-60 mph time of 2.6 seconds. The Jesko
            Absolut gets a twin-turbocharged V8 with up to 1,600hp when it's
            running on E85 race fuel.
          </p>
          <h6>9. Lamborghini Revuelto</h6>
          <img
            src="images/lamborghini-revuelto.jpeg"
            alt="Lamborghini Revuelto"
          />
          <p class="par">
            Lamborghini Revuelto is a 2 seater hybrid Coupe car with AWD option.
            It can hit a top speed of 217 mph / 349 kph with a 0-60 mph time of
            2.5 seconds.
          </p>
          <h6>8. Pagani Huayra</h6>
          <img src="images/pagani-huayra.jpeg" alt="Pagani Huayra" />
          <p class="par">
            The Pagani Huayra is a fantastic looking car. Every detail is
            exquisite, and it's more than just a pin-up as well. It has an AMG
            derived twin-turbocharged V12 engine putting out 730hp and 1,000Nm
            of torque, enough for a top speed of 238mph. It can hit a top speed
            of 238 mph / 383 kph with a 0-60 mph time of 3.2 seconds. The Huayra
            is made mostly of carbon fibre to keep the weight down, as well as
            to make it more rigid, and it's covered in active aero to help it
            slip through the air more easily.
          </p>
          <h6>7. Aston Martin Valkyrie</h6>
          <img src="images/am-valkyrie.jpeg" alt="Aston Martin Valkyrie" />
          <p class="par">
            This beast has a top speed of 250mph. Mounted behind the driver is a
            6.5-litre hybrid V12 with 1,160hp, capable of pushing this F1
            inspired road-racer from 0-60mph in 2.5 seconds. Not really
            surprising when you realise that it weighs just over a tonne.
          </p>
          <h6>6. Koenigsegg Regera</h6>
          <img src="images/koenigsegg-regera.jpeg" alt="Koenigsegg Regera" />
          <p class="par">
            This is a Swedish speed machine which comes with a twin-turbo V8
            engine and an electric motor that produce a total of 1,500hp. Unlike
            any other car on this list, the Regera can go from 0-250mph using
            just ONE gear. Yep, no matter if you're cruising at 30mph or aiming
            to hit its 250mph top speed (on a closed course, not the M1) you'll
            be in the same gear. Seems a little bonkers.
          </p>
          <h6>5. McLaren Speedtail</h6>
          <img src="images/mclaren-speedtail.jpeg" alt="McLaren Speedtail" />
          <p class="par">
            The Speedtail is McLaren's first ever Hyper-GT. It has a top speed
            of 250.4 mph (403 km/h) and can accelerate from 0-299 km/h (0-186
            mph) in 12.8 seconds
          </p>
          <h6>4. Rimac Nevera</h6>
          <img src="images/nevera.jpeg" alt="Nevera" />
          <p class="par">
            This ballistic EV hypercar has four electric motors, producing a
            whopping 1,914hp and 2,300Nm of torque. That's enough to launch it
            from 0-60mph in just 1.9 seconds, and it can go on to a top speed of
            258mph. It's made almost entirely out of carbon fibre to keep the
            weight down, but this isn't just some stripped-out drag racer. The
            interior is a lovely place to be and you still get all the luxuries
            you'd expect of a car that costs Â£2 million.
          </p>
          <h6>3. Hennessey Venom F5</h6>
          <img src="images/hennessey-venom-f5.jpeg" alt="Hennessey" />
          <p class="par">
            The Venom F5 is an all-new hypercar designed and built from the
            ground up by Hennessey Special Vehicles. The F5 name is a reference
            to the F5 tornado, the highest rating on the Fujita scale, attaining
            wind speeds as high as 261-318 mph (420-512 km/h). The Hennessey
            Venom F5 has a 6.6-litre twin-turbocharged V8 with 1,817hp and
            1,617Nm of torque which can launch it from 0-60mph in 2.6 seconds
          </p>
          <h6>2. SSC Tuatara</h6>
          <img src="images/tuatara.jpeg" alt="Tuatara" />
          <p class="par">
            The SSC Tuatara is a sports car designed, developed and manufactured
            by American automobile manufacturer SSC North America (formerly
            Shelby SuperCars Inc.) SC, or Shelby SuperCars, was one of the
            supercar success stories of the mid-2000s. And not just because its
            breakout model, the Ultimate Aero TT, made it into limited
            production. In fact, the car broadsided the entire supercar
            establishment by nicking the road car top speed record in 2007,
            recording a 256mph vmax on a closed road in Washington State. It has
            1,350bhp and can do 0-60mph in 2.5 seconds
          </p>
          <h6>1. Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+</h6>
          <img src="images/bugatti.jpeg" alt="Bugatti" />
          <p class="par">
            This machine has a top speed of 304mph which it did when the French
            firm unleashed it at Volkswagen's Ehra-Lessien test track. It can go
            from 0-60mph in 2.2 seconds. The Chiron 300+ doesn't hold the
            official world record though, as it only did the run in one
            direction. To break the record you have to do it twice in opposite
            directions, which Bugatti decided not to do for some reason.
